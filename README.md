# MedilanceApp
Medilance is a brand identity application, comprised of material design. This app helps to display the products offered by the Medilance Healthcare Pharma Company using REST API. The Application parses the JSON file received from GET to parse into object model. This model is stored in a list and is rendered by ListView Builder.

# Introduction
This application has three main tabs:
1) HOME
2) CONTACT US
3) PRODUCT LIST

The Home Page consists of sections like Testimonials, Details and type of products Offered.
There is a floating WhatsApp button that can redirect to the companyâ€™s WhatsApp account directly, in case of general queries. The images on the homepage are implemented using rows and scrollable vertically.
The product list button redirects to the original website to buy and order the products offered by the company. We can add the items in the basket and check out accordingly.
